# Security Control Types


There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of security controls that organizations can implement to reduce risk. The good news is that you don’t need to be an expert on all the possible security controls. However, you do need to have a basic understanding of control categories and control types. 

Control categories describe how a control works. CompTIA lists the following control categories in the objectives:

* **Technical controls** use technology such as hardware, software, and firmware to reduce risk. 
* **Managerial controls** are primarily administrative in function. They are typically documented in an organization’s security policy and focus on managing risk. 
* **Operational controls** help ensure that the day-to-day operations of an organization comply with the security policy. People implement them. 
* **Physical controls** impact the physical world, such as locks on doors, fences, security guards, and other objects that you can physically touch

Control types describe the goal that the control is trying to achieve. CompTIA lists the following control types in the objectives: 

* **Preventive controls** attempt to prevent an incident from occurring. 
* **Detective controls** attempt to detect incidents after they have occurred. 
* **Corrective controls** attempt to restore normal operations after an incident occurs. 
* **Deterrent controls** attempt to discourage individuals from causing an incident. Compensating controls are alternative controls used when a primary control is not feasible. 
* **Directive controls** provide instruction to individuals on how they should handle security- related situations that arise

# Control Categories
 The control categories (technical, managerial, operational, and physical) describe how the control works. Technical controls use technology to achieve their goals. Managerial controls use administrative functions. Operational controls are implemented by operational staff. 
 Physical controls use physical safeguards. Let’s look at each of these categories. 
 
 
## Technical Controls 
 **Technical controls** use technology such as hardware, software, and firmware to reduce vulnerabilities. An administrator installs and configures a technical control, and the technical control then provides protection automatically. Throughout this book, you’ll come across several examples of technical controls. The following list provides a few examples: 
 
 * Encryption. Encryption is a strong technical control used to protect the confidentiality of data. This includes data transferred over a network as well as data stored on devices like servers, desktop computers, and mobile devices. 
 * Antivirus software. Once installed, the antivirus software provides protection against malware infection. Chapter 6, “Comparing Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Common Attacks,” covers malware and antivirus software in depth. 
 * Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs). IDSs and IPSs can monitor a network or host for intrusions and provide ongoing protection against various threats. Chapter 4, “Securing Your Network,” covers different types of IDSs and IPSs. 
 
 * Firewalls. Network firewalls restrict network traffic going in and out of a network. Chapter 3, “Exploring Network Technologies and Tools,” covers firewalls in depth. 
 
 * Least privilege. The least privilege principle specifies that individuals or processes are granted only the privileges they need to perform their assigned tasks or functions, but no more. Privileges are a combination of rights and permissions. 
 

 ## Managerial Controls 
 **Managerial controls** are primarily administrative in function and are typically documented in an organization’s written security policy. These controls use planning and assessment methods to review the organization’s ability to reduce and manage risk. Chapter 8, “Using Risk Management Tools,” covers vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, which fall into this category. For example, two common managerial controls are: 
 
 * **Risk assessments**. These help organizations quantify and qualify risks within an organization so that team members can focus on the serious risks. For example, a quantitative risk assessment uses cost and asset values to quantify risks based on monetary values. A qualitative risk assessment uses judgments to categorize risks based on probability and impact. 
 
 * **Vulnerability assessments**. A vulnerability assessment attempts to discover current vulnerabilities. When necessary, additional controls are implemented to reduce the risk from these vulnerabilities.


## Operational Controls 
**Operational controls** help ensure that the day-to-day operations of an organization comply with their overall security plan. These are controls that are primarily implemented and executed by people instead of systems. Operational controls include the following families: 
* Awareness and training. The importance of training to reduce risks cannot be overstated. Training helps users maintain password security, follow a clean desk policy, understand threats such as phishing and malware, and much more. 

* Configuration management. Configuration management often uses baselines to ensure that systems start in a secure, hardened state. Change management helps ensure that changes don’t result in unintended configuration errors. Chapter 5 covers change and configuration management in more detail. 

* Media protection. Media includes physical media such as USB flash drives, external and internal drives, and backup tapes. That media may contain sensitive information and must be protected against loss or theft. Media protection policies describe how you use backups and encryption to protect media containing sensitive information. These concepts are covered in more detail in Chapter 9.


 ## Physical Controls
 **Physical controls** are any controls that you can physically touch.
Some examples include bollards and other barricades, access control
 vestibules (sometimes called mantraps), lighting, signs, fences,
 sensors, and more. It’s important to realize that you can identify
 physical controls as other control types. For example, physical
 controls such as locks are both preventive and deterrent controls. A
 locked door prevents personnel from entering a secure area and
 deters individuals from even trying if they know the door is locked.
 You’ll need to understand a variety of physical security controls for
 the Security+ exam. You’ll find them covered in Chapter 9
